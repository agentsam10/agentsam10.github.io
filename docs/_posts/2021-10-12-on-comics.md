Hello again. I'm writing this blog entry near the start of my very busy reading week. Today I spent a lot of time getting caught up on some lectures and assignments. Still have a lot more to go. Anyways, on to the point of this entry. Tomorrow is comic book day, at least for those of us who don't just buy DC. This week's big title is Immortal Hulk #50, the finale to Al Ewing's run on Hulk. I've attempted to buy comics many times over the course of my life, and this current run of buying was all spurred by this comic. I didn't start buying until #41, after I had caught up using the trades. The horror elements combined with the genuinely interesting dive into the Hulk and Bruce Banner's psychology has made it a treat to pick up each and every month since. I feel like a lot of joy in life comes from anticipation, and sometimes this becomes more enjoyable than the actual thing itself. I think everyone has bought into the hype of a TV show or Video Game at one point in their lives. Even then, there's just something fun about this serialized form of storytelling. People might complain about cliff hangers, but suspense is just something that's fun to experience, at least for a little while. All in all, I hope I don't end up finishing the comic tomorrow and realising that I've made myself disappointed by hyping it up, but honestly I trust in the series' writing.
