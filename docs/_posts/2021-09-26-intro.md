I think it's time for me to make the blog template I've had on my GitHub Pages into an actual blog. We have been using our pages to host WebGL builds of our GDW game, so I think it's a good idea that people don't just get a random site when they go to the main page. So hello. I guess I'll actually start blogging here, as narcissistic as that may be.
